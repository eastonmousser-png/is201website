        <p>This website was created for my IS 201 assignment. I built everything in VS Code using basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. The links above will take you to my scratch page, my resume page, and the small web app I made for the project.</p>
        <p>The main goal was just to show that I understand how to structure pages, use a stylesheet, embed media, and put everything online so it works like a real site.</p>
